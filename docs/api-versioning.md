# API Versioning & Backward Compatibility

- APIs follow semantic versioning: MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH.
- Backward-compatible changes (additive fields, optional params) increment MINOR.
- Breaking changes require new MAJOR version and coexistence of old versions for at least one release cycle.
- Deprecated endpoints are supported for 6 months before removal.
